    <h1>Standalone Widget Test</h1>
    <p>The widget should appear below:</p>
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Widget Container -->
    <my-widget></my-widget>

    <!-- Load the widget script -->
    <script src="./dist/react-widget-uv.js"></script>
    
    <!-- 
       Note: The widget's Shadow DOM isolates styles.
       The widget is configured to look for './nextjs.css' relative to itself (or the page).
       Ensure 'nextjs.css' is in the same directory as this HTML file or the script depending on how it's served.
       For this test, we assume test-widget.html is in root and dist/ is accessible.
       However, the widget thinks './nextjs.css' is relative to the *document* or the *script* depending on implementation.
       I implemented it as `link.href = './nextjs.css'` which is relative to the *document* (this HTML file).
       So we need to make sure 'nextjs.css' is served at './nextjs.css' relative to this file.
       
       But wait, the files are in 'dist/'. 
       If I open 'test-widget.html' in the root, './nextjs.css' looks for 'nextjs.css' in the root.
       It is in 'dist/nextjs.css'.
       
       Ideally, the widget should know where its resources are.
       For this simple test, I will COPY the css to root or adjust the widget to look in dist?
       No, let's just create the test file expecting the user to copy assets or serve root.
       
       Actually, a better test setup:
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="./dist/nextjs.css"> (If I wasn't using Shadow DOM)
       
       Since I am using Shadow DOM and manual injection:
       The widget injects `<link href="./nextjs.css">`.
       This is relative to the PAGE url.
       If page is `.../test-widget.html`, it looks for `.../nextjs.css`.
       So I should put this HTML file in `dist/` folder for it to work out of the box?
       OR I should have compiled the widget to know its path (import.meta.url).
       
       Let's place this file in ROOT, but telling the user that for the CSS to load, 
       they currently need `nextjs.css` next to the HTML file OR update the widget code to use absolute paths/CDN.
       
       For now, I'll create `dist/test.html` instead so it works out of the box with the relative link.
